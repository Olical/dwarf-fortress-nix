= Dwarf Fortress Nix

This is copied from https://github.com/Olical/nixpkgs[my fork of the nixpkgs repository]. I can't get it working perfectly well with the newest versions of DF so I've decided to maintain a mostly working and up to date version in my own stand alone repo until it's stable and ready for a PR.

== Caveats

 * When running through `dfhack` (as you probably should) the game doesn't fully quit when you try to close it.
 ** Use `die` in `dfhack` to close the game properly and quickly.
 * If you try to use sound the game won't launch or possibly even segfault.
 ** Configure the game to not use sound at all at install.

== Installation

I install it through https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager[home-manager] using the following:

[source,nix]
----
{ pkgs, ... }:

let
  df-pkg = pkgs.callPackage (import (fetchTarball https://github.com/Olical/dwarf-fortress-nix/archive/main.tar.gz)) {};
  dwarf-fortress = (df-pkg.dwarf-fortress-full.override {
    dfVersion = "0.47.05";
    enableIntro = false;
    enableSound = false;
    enableFPS = true;
  });
in
{
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    dwarf-fortress
  ];
}

I may be depending on this repo in a weird way, so if there's a better approach please let me know!
